      <p class="tekstRechts">Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow "runners" for a shot at escape. Awakening in an elevator, remembering nothing of his past, Thomas emerges into a world of about thirty teenage boys, all without past memories, who have learned to survive under their own set of rules in a completely enclosed environment, subsisting on their own agriculture and supplies. They have begun to give up hope when a comatose girl arrives with a strange note, and their world begins to change with the boys dividing into two factions: <em>those willing to risk their lives to escape and those wanting to hang onto what they've got and survive.</em><br>
